# kamanapp

The basic front-end side for a kamansoft javascript full stack solution

This try to be a boilerplate structure for a fast development of 
browser based front-end apps, using among other goodies backbone and 
Marionette frameworks.

The main idea is to build event driven apps 


## Prerequisits

This was build using nodejs 0.10  and npm  1.3.4, also you will need 
browserify to compile your solution in only one script, and 
Browseryfy-handlebars to allow requesting handlebar like template files


So assuming you are am debian user or a debian based linux user  running
the next commands as root should be enough: 
  
    $apt-get install nodejs npm 
    $npm install -g browserify 
    $npm install -g browserify-handlebars


## Installation

First you need to clone this project inside a public folder of your http 
server (/etc/www/ for example if you are using apache2 on debian/ubuntu)
